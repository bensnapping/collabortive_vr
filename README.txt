Setting up Git (and Github) on Windows:
https://www.webdevdrops.com/en/git-on-windows-github-install-configure/

The UnityProject folder is where the Unity files are kept for the main scene.
The AvatarAssets folder is where we can store avatar files as Travis makes changes to them.



To make changes to the repository:
If you have Git installed on your computer and connected to the repository,
open the terminal (or Git Bash on Windows)

1. Navigate to your local directory and 'git add .'

2. Then 'git commit -m "This is a description of the changes" '

3. Then 'git push'

We are also using Git LFS (Git Large File Storage) because some of the .psd and .hdr files
were too large for normal Github. Contact me or follow the instructions at https://git-lfs.github.com
when you go to set this up.

If you're just adding a file, you can go to the Github repository at
https://github.com/bensnapping/collaborative_vr and click the "Add File"
button. Then drag the files into the repository. Don't forget to add a
commit message.

If you're just GETTING a file/folder, you can go to the Github repository and click the 
green "code" button just right of the "Add file" button and then select "Download ZIP"
from the dropdown.
